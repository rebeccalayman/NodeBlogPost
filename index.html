          <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
          <p>Node.js, often called simply "Node" in conversation, is a development platform built on top
		  of Google's V8 JavaScript virtual machine. While JavaScript engines (including V8) are 
		  traditionally run in Web browsers to form the client side of a client/server application, 
		  the Node.js libraries are focused on building server-side applications in JavaScript. Node.js
		  applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, 
		  Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and IBM. 
		  <br><br>
		  Node.js was created and first published for Linux use in 2009. Its development and maintenance
		  was spearheaded by Ryan Dahl and sponsored by Joyent, the firm where Dahl worked. Dahl was 
		  inspired to create Node.js after seeing a file upload progress bar on Flickr. The browser did
		  not know how much of the file had been uploaded and had to query the Web server. Dahl desired
		  an easier way. It heralded international attention after its debut at the inaugural JSConf EU
		  conference in November 2009. </p>

          <h2>Digging Deeper into Node.js</h2>
          <p>How it works under-the-hood is pretty interesting. Compared to traditional web-serving 
		  techniques where each connection (request) spawns a new thread, taking up system RAM and 
		  eventually maxing-out at the amount of RAM available, Node.js operates on a single-thread,  
		  allowing it to support tens of thousands of concurrent connections (held in the event loop).
		  <br><br>
		  This relates to one of the major advantages of Node.js, according to its creator Ryan Dahl, 
		  which is that it does not block input/output (I/O). Some developers are highly critical of
		  Node.js and point out that if a single process requires a significant number of CPU cycles, 
		  the application will block and that the blocking can crash the application. Proponents of the
		  Node.js model claim that CPU processing time is less of a concern because of the high number 
		  of small processes that Node code is based on.</p>

          <h2>An Example of Node.js</h2>
          <p>In the simplest example, we have a single chatroom on our website where people come and 
		  can exchange messages in one-to-many fashion. For instance, say we have three people on the
		  website all connected to our message board.
		  <br><br>
		  When one of the clients posts a message, here’s what happens:</p>
          <ol>
		  <li>Browser catches the ‘Send’ button click through a JavaScript handler, picks up the value
		  from the input field (i.e., the message text), and emits a websocket message using the 
		  websocket client connected to our server (initialized on web page initialization).</li>
		  <li>Server-side component of the websocket connection receives the message and forwards it to 
		  all other connected clients using the broadcast method.</li>
		  <li>All clients receive the new message as a push message via a websockets client-side 
		  component running within the web page. They then pick up the message content and update the 
		  web page in-place by appending the new message to the board.</li>
		  </ol>
